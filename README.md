# Climate Recognizance
 The goal of this website is to enable users to check the weather in all cities in the western hemisphere, providing temperature and description for specification.
This was achieved using 3 coding languages and 1 API. HTML, Javascript and css the api used was openweathermapapi.

  HTML served as the frmaework for the website while java script made the website interactive and capable of achieving the desired outcome.
CSS was used to style the website changing different aspects of the page as needed and desired.
For HTML I started the basic structure for html doc in english, around line 7 i used the link element and rel attribute to create a relationship with the html and style.css, the href attribute was used to specify the link whitch was the style css file.
I added a element on line 11 of html with the class of "data-time-container", and also "date-time" to add the date and time to the top of the screen. "Text-align" reference was used to center the date in the middle of the page.
div elements with multiple class attributes were added along side a script element linking the javascript inside of the html.

added multiple var elements to create buttons with functions designated upon clicking them.
Added a fetch element to recieve information from the opnweather api upon entering a cities name.
added link to api key url as well as personalized api key in correct format resulting in the data showing on the website.
CSS was used to style the color of the background, used to customize all font sizes depicted on the screen.
The only problem faced was linking local storage to save data used on website, this is the first goal of innovation I have for this website in the future.
